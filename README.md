It is possible to protect your links with a password as well as to choose how long the file will be kept on the server. The file and the link will self-destruct after this time. Downloads of transmitted files can be limited to a certain date, and each file can self-destruct after the first download. Jirafeau allows you to configure maximum retention times and maximum size per file. Encryption is available as an option.
