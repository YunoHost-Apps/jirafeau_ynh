### Changing the conditions of use of the service

The license text on the "Terms of Service" page, which is shipped with the default installation, is "based on the Open Source Initiative Terms of Service". To change this text simply copy the file `/lib/tos.original.txt`, rename it to `/lib/tos.local.txt` and adapt it to your own needs. If you update the installation, then only the `tos.original.txt` file may change eventually, not your `tos.local.txt file`.

### Administration

To administer the files within Jirafeau it is enough to go to the address `__DOMAIN__/admin.php`.
